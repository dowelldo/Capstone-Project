<br><p>Just got this today so I will revise if my opinion changes.I have a Gear 3 Frontier which I wear everyday for its communication, health and safety features, so I need a band that is comfortable while driving, keyboarding, gardening, etc., dark to dark. It also needs to be easy to adjust throughout the day. The original silicon band was too stiff and too hot. Nylon bands were hot and stiff, almost cutting into the skin at the edges. The Band felt secure and was easy to adjust but was too wide for comfort and its velcro attracted lint. The affordable leather bands on Amazon look cheap and I'm allergic to metal bands. Whine, whine, whine, right?This canvas band hits all my marks. Breathable, easy to attach to the watch, comfortable width without the wider patch under the watch itself like The Band, lots of holes set close together for easy adjustment, cleans with damp cloth, fits on the charger, overall a nice compromise between sturdy and good-looking.  The red is a true blue red that looks great with my black watch.  I will be back for more colors.</p>
<br><p>Really happy with this so far! Admittedly, it's only been a week, but I much prefer this band to the one that comes with the LG Watch style, not only because I don't like wearing leather, but also because it looks better on the wrist by sitting more flush.I bought this hoping that it would prevent any sweating and it's been perfect. The color selection is a bonus! I will say, for the LG Watch Style, you will not be able to attach this band using the easy, "swappable" band feature. You will need a small screwdriver to remove the bar that holds on to the original band in order to install this one. It's still a pretty easy process that you can look up on Youtube, but it's much more work than the clip-on bands that the watch comes with.The quality of the band is great, too. It doesn't feel or look cheap or flimsy. Hoping to get it in some more colors soon!</p>
<br><p>I think the size might be a little off in the advertisement. Perhaps not counting for the pins. I bought it to replace a worn out band for my Tag Heuer Aquaracer 500m Auto/Crono. The rubber band that came with my 5k+ watch is absolute crap. It looks amazing as one would imagine at that price point however the build quality is garbage at least for this particular band. This $20 generic replacement band is of a higher build quality than that Tag Heuer rubber band. The one I ordered was a 22mm with the pins it was too wide for my watch, as with just about anything with amazon returning was quick and simple no issues at all there, I purchased one size smaller it should be here tomorrow and I'm looking forward to installing it.The band is really good quality not just "for the price" but overall, it really is a quality band I could do without the brand logo but at least it isn't too intrusive, it's underneath the band so you won't be advertising for them walking around.</p>
<br><p>Not sure what rating to give it because I had to alter it a bit to make it work. My watch's band was 20mm but I didn't realize that my spring bar was much less than 20mm. Obviously not Barton's fault, but I had to return the 20mm. I got an 18mm and that still didn't fit so I had to remove Barton's quick release bar and put in my watch's stock spring bar which was less than 18mm. My watch is a Casio Illuminator.Next, I took off the Barton logo patch to increase smoothness. The patch has some scratchy edges. Removing it is easy and doesn't damage the band.Then I tried breaking in the canvas by twisting it around, getting it wet, and just roughing it up. This helped make it more comfortable.Overall, a good product. A little rough, but that should fade with time. Being Prime and having a great return policy was also a plus.</p>

<br><p>This is a nice, quality watch strap for my smartwatch. It has some stiffness to maintain a shape (so it's not just a loose fabric loop on your wrist), but it's not uncomfortable at all. It's well made, and should last quite a long time. I ordered the Nantucket blue, and it looks good with my titanium-cased watch.One of my quick-release pins gets stuck, so it takes some working to get it to engage/disengage. And the reinforcement stitching around the eye holes doesn't look as nice as it does in the photos. It's actually a shade lighter than the band, so the stitching sticks out a bit. Finally, the length of the band is just OK. I can only get the band to the third eye hole, which negates the floating band loop (yes, it can be taken off). I just wish the band was a bit longer. My wrists are not THAT big, so I can only assume others would have issue with the strap fitting.Overall, and good quality casual replacement watch strap.</p>
<br><p>Purchased this canvas band for my Garmin vivoactive 3. It fit well and looked great, so I went ahead and ordered a Barton buckle in gunmetal grey to better match my Garmin watch styling vs. the bright stainless steel buckle.After a couple days, the stitching in the canvas band started to come loose. (Some other reviewers also had this issue.) I contacted Barton and they sent out a replacement canvas band, as well as a free silicone strap for my inconvenience. Excellent customer service.The replacement canvas band arrived and I installed it. The stitching looked better, so I was pleased. But when I woke up in the morning, the band had detached from one side of my device in the night. I assumed I had put it on incorrectly, and reattached it. A few hours later, the pin detached again and my watch fell onto the hard concrete. After the third time the band detached and fell off, I contacted Barton again.They asked me if I had a Garmin vivo device. Once I confirmed, they quickly sent (copy/paste) a lengthy and very detailed explanation saying they receive mixed comments from Garmin customers, did their own research with a Garmin vivomove HR device, and claimed Garmin was "dancing to the beat of its own drum" vs. using a standard 20mm lug width. They apologized and said they would issue me a refund.I can only attest to the three Barton bands I received. The first canvas band fit great, but the stitching fell apart at the seams. The replacement canvas band repeatedly came disconnected from my device and is unusable - stitching looked better. The complimentary silicone band fit great and stayed connected. I compared the two canvas bands and can definitely see with the naked eye that the pin that keeps coming loose is shorter than the one in the band that stays attached. I don't believe it's a Garmin issue, but rather a quality control issue with the Barton bands...at least with the three bands I had to compare.That being said, the company has awesome customer service. They replied to all my messages promptly, tried to resolve my issue, and refunded my money when they couldn't.Thought I'd write this review for other Garmin vivoactive 3 wearers who want to give this band a try. Yours may fit perfectly, or it may not. The seller seems willing to refund money when it does not. It's worth the risk in my opinion since the band looks great when it fits properly. Just be prepared to catch your watch in mid-air if it detaches.I'd give this band five stars if I received one that had good stitching AND two pins that fit properly. Onto searching for a different brand...</p>
<br><p>Looks great but the seams started to fray and become undone the first day I used it. I contacted Barton about it and got absolutely no response. I like their straps as this was my third Barton strap to purchase and never had a problem with my previous straps but God forbid you have anything wrong with the product out of the box because Barton customer service will not help you.</p>
